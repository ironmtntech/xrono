[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isotope11/xrono.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isotope11/xrono)

Xrono is a mature, open source, time tracking solution for your business.
Developed by Isotope11, Xrono is intended to be a core technology for smooth
operation of consultancies. Xrono allows team members to bill time against
clients, and then admins to easily export invoices and payroll into their
accounting systems. Beyond that, it has vacation time management, overtime,
client access and notification, and many more features. Xrono is currently under
active development, so feel free to check out our
[support](http://www.xrono.org/#support) section of our
[website](http://www.xrono.org/) if you have any questions.
